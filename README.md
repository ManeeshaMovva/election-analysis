Election Audit Summary
The Script can be modified one of two ways to be used for any upcoming election: seeing as this election only used polling from three counties, we can modify the script to determine voting statistics for all of the counties in Colorado. Another way to use this script in the future is by using a different set of data. You would save that set of data in a .csv file if not already saved like that and use that file with this script. You would modify the name of the .cvs file in your script to make sure it's pulling the correct file.
